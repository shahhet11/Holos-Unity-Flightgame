# Holos-Unity-Flightgame

Unity 2021.3.22f1 Personal
Microsoft Visual Studio Community 2019 Version 16.11.29

# Project highlights:
This is an endless survival type game that features an airplane/flight controller with fluent and smooth controls. The controller can perform actions like thrust, pitch, roll, bank, and has a booster. I have featured two types of weapons: primary (shoots bullets) and secondary (shoots missiles with target locking system) to destroy enemy AI. I have fine-tuned the AI in such a way that it can dodge and avoid asteroid obstacles in its path way and it can fire bullets towards the playerâ€™s plane/flight.

# Controls:
1) W/S -> Pitch
2) A/D -> Bank
3) Q/E -> Roll (in-place)
4) Space -> Jet Boost
5) LShift -> Speed Brake
6) LCtrl -> Slow motion
7) Left Click -> Fire Primary Weapon (Bullets)
8) Right Click -> Fire Secondary Weapon (Missile - based on a nearest enemy target lock system)

# Unique Features: 
1) Dynamic Aiming on screen-space
2) Jet Booster with flight's mesh trailing VFX. (Created it from scratch using Shadergraph.)
3) Slow-motion allows you to assess the critical situation when you are surrounded by a large pool of AI planes

# Pre-made Assets Used:
1) bullet and missile Projectile Particle effects: I have made a custom Particle effect from 3 different source which has muzzlePE, BulletProjectilePE, HitBlastPE. [Link](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/vfx/particles/epic-toon-fx-57772)
2) StarField Skybox.[Link](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/2d/textures-materials/sky/starfield-skybox-92717)
3) Asteroid FBX Models. [Link](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/environments/sci-fi/asteroids-low-poly-pack-142164)
4) Royalty free stock UI images for HUD and SFX for jet-engine sound.
